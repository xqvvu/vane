# The vp image already ships the C/C++ toolchain (`gcc`, `make`, `python3`), so
# no extra packages are needed for native addons. node-gyp is not in the image,
# but better-sqlite3 ships a `binding.gyp` with no `install` script, and npm and
# pnpm both run the implicit `node-gyp rebuild` for that case. It does not
# actually compile: `binding.gyp` shells out to `node lib/binding.js`, sees the
# bundled prebuilt binary, and takes the empty branch.
