# Vane Settings Tabbed Workspace

Targeted edit for the existing Vane Console Settings screen. Preserve the
shared 48px top navigation shell, active Settings item, Vane Console design
system, compact shadcn/base-lyra operational style, neutral light theme,
restrained typography, flat 1px bordered panels, and Remix Icon-like icon
language.

Settings should support three operator modes:

1. Routine configuration through UI controls.
2. Raw portable TOML editing/import/export.
3. Raw portable JSON editing/import/export.

The page must feel like dense self-hosted SRE software, not SaaS account
settings, billing, tenant administration, profile management, or incident
workflow software.

## Page Structure

1. **App Shell:** Keep the existing compact top header with Vane brand,
   horizontal navigation, active Settings nav item, initials/user menu, and no
   left sidebar.

2. **Page Header and Top Controls:** Directly below the shell content area,
   place a compact bordered workspace header with:
   - Title `Settings`
   - Small outline `Configuration` badge
   - No descriptive paragraph
   - A top control row containing the `UI` / `TOML` / `JSON` tab navigation aligned
     left and a small outline `Refresh` action aligned right

3. **Tabs:** The top control row uses a line-style tab bar with exactly three
   tabs:
   - `UI`
   - `TOML`
   - `JSON`

   `UI` is selected by default with a clear underline/active state. Inactive
   tabs should be quiet. Do not create a secondary sidebar or persistent right
   rail.

4. **Notice Slot:** Reserve a low-profile full-width alert slot below the
   tab/action row for failed update/import/export actions or import results
   with one-time source tokens. Keep it narrow and operational, not a large
   card.

5. **UI Tab Content:**
   - First panel: `OperationalSummary` with enabled Sources, enabled
     Destinations, enabled Routes, and raw payload retention days. Render it as
     one flat segmented summary band, not four nested metric cards.
   - Below the summary, a responsive asymmetric two-column grid. Give the
     `App Settings` panel slightly more width for the raw payload retention days
     field and compact `Save settings` action. Use the narrower `Language`
     panel for dashboard language preference.
   - Remove the old `Portability and Safety` facts panel entirely.
   - Keep helper copy concise.

6. **TOML and JSON Tab Content:**
   - Each format uses the same wide code-oriented panel titled `Portable
configuration`.
   - Include a compact format badge and concise helper text.
   - Editor area should look like GitHub light CodeMirror: white/light editor
     surface, line number gutter, syntax-colored TOML or JSON sample text, wrapped
     long lines, comfortable fixed height, and no plaintext secrets.
   - Use the same CodeMirror geometry, gutter width, fold markers, focus ring,
     syntax theme, editor height, and footer placement for both formats.
   - Footer actions:
     - Outline `Export current config`
     - Primary `Apply import`, visually disabled when editor is empty.
   - Both editors are editable. Import validates the selected format before
     applying the configuration transaction.

7. **Responsive Behavior:** On narrow widths, keep tabs at the top, stack UI
   panels vertically, and keep the TOML/JSON editor full-width without horizontal
   page overflow.

## Product Boundaries

- Do not add profile management, password changes, OAuth provider setup,
  organizations, teams, billing, SaaS tenants, invitations, marketplaces,
  workflow graphs, arbitrary JavaScript, SQL, shell execution, silences,
  maintenance windows, on-call schedules, incident management, or worker tuning.
- Do not expose source tokens except one-time generated tokens in the import
  result notice.
- Do not expose token hashes, provider signing secrets, destination webhook
  URLs, signing secrets, access tokens, passwords, private keys, raw secret
  config, raw sensitive payloads, Better Auth secrets, session tokens, or
  password hashes.
- Export omits plaintext secrets by default. Do not add a `Secrets omitted`
  toggle unless the backend supports plaintext secret export.

## Implementation Mapping Notes

- Map the design to existing React feature modules:
  `SettingsPage`, `OperationalSummary`, `AppSettingsForm`,
  `LanguageSettingsPanel`, `PortableConfigForm`, and `ImportNoticePanel`.
- The TOML and JSON editors map to CodeMirror language integrations, not plain
  textareas.
- Use existing shadcn primitives such as `Tabs`, `Button`, `Alert`, `Badge`,
  `Field`, `Input`, `Separator`, and compact bordered panels.
- Keep TanStack Form as the raw retention form behavior owner.
- Keep server state TanStack Query-backed through existing configuration query
  options and configuration mutations.
